# Artificial Neural Network with Dropout Visualization

This project demonstrates a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras, with a focus on visualizing the effect of dropout regularization.  It uses the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits) for training and includes code to visualize how dropout affects neuron activations.

## Key Features

* **ANN Model with Dropout:** A feedforward neural network with two dense layers and dropout layers for regularization.
* **MNIST Dataset:** Uses the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
* **Dropout Visualization:** Includes a function to visualize the effect of dropout by showing neuron activations with and without a simulated dropout mask.
* **Training and Evaluation:** Code for training the model and evaluating its performance on the test set.
* **Reproducibility:** Includes setting random seeds for consistent results.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow (>= 2.0)
* Keras (included in TensorFlow)
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
2.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the `ann_with_dropout.py` script:**
    ```bash
    python ann_with_dropout.py
    ```
    This will:
    * Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
    * Create the ANN model with dropout.
    * Print a summary of the model architecture.
    * Train the model for a specified number of epochs.
    * Evaluate the model on the test set and print the loss and accuracy.
    * Generate a visualization showing the effect of dropout on neuron activations for a sample image.

## Code Description

* `ann_with_dropout.py`:
    * `create_model_with_dropout(input_shape, dropout_rate)`:  Defines the ANN model with dense layers and dropout layers.  The `dropout_rate` parameter controls the probability of a neuron's output being set to zero during training.
    * `load_and_preprocess_mnist()`:  Loads the MNIST dataset, flattens the images, normalizes the pixel values, and one-hot encodes the labels.
    * `visualize_dropout(model, sample_input, layer_name)`:  Simulates the effect of dropout on a single input sample.  It retrieves the activations of a specified layer, applies a random dropout mask, and plots the activations with and without dropout.  This function helps to visualize how dropout affects the network's representations.
    * `train_and_evaluate_model(model, x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, epochs, batch_size)`:  Trains the given model on the training data and evaluates it on the test data.
    * The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block:  This is the main part of the script that loads the data, creates the model, trains it, and visualizes the dropout.

## Visualization

The script generates a plot that shows the activations of a layer with and without dropout.  This visualization helps to understand how dropout prevents neurons from becoming overly reliant on each other, leading to more robust feature learning.

## Model Architecture

The ANN model has the following architecture:

* Input Layer:  784 neurons (flattened 28x28 MNIST image)
* Dense Layer 1:  512 neurons, ReLU activation
* Dropout Layer 1:  Dropout rate of 0.2
* Dense Layer 2:  256 neurons, ReLU activation
* Dropout Layer 2:  Dropout rate of 0.2
* Output Layer:  10 neurons (one for each digit 0-9), Softmax activation

## Dropout Explanation

Dropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting in neural networks.  During training, dropout randomly "drops out" (sets to zero) a fraction of the neurons in a layer.  This forces the network to learn more robust features that are not dependent on any specific neuron.  During inference (when making predictions), all neurons are active, but their outputs are scaled down to compensate for the missing neurons during training.
